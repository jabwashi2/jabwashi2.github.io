                    <p>This simple graphics engine was created using DirectX11 between August 2023 and December 2023. This engine can render 3D objects within a simple scene. It supports lighting, shadows, materials, specularity, and a simple post processing effect (box blur). The development of this project was supported by my professor, and updates to the engine gradually became more self guided as time went on. Throughout working on this project, I gained a deep love for graphics progrmaming and rendering engineering, as well as engine programming. I was introduced to new methods of using graphics APIs and learned a lot about optimizing performance. In the future, I would like to expand upon the functionality of this graphics engine to allow for easier additions of 3D models, deleting of models, and more post processing effects (such as bloom and gaussian blur), as well as general performance improvements. <strong>This project is completed and available to view.</strong></p>

                    <p>This website was made as a submission to the 24 hour hackathon Black Wings Hacks 2024 hosted by the Black Wings group under Rewriting The Code. The Black Game Dev Hub (BGDH) serves to provide resources to Black game developers of all experience levels, whether that be to provide tools and learning opportunities or to provide inspiration. The colors of the BGDH logo take their inspiration from the colors commonly used by African Americans (black, green, red, yellow, and white). The goal of the project was to be a place where many different resources can be accessed at once, greatly reducing the amount of jumping around game devs need to do, while also ensuring that there is a focus placed on uplifting and supporting other Black game developers like myself. The array of resources included spans many disciplines in order to provide for as many people as possible. I am aiming to continue refining and improving this website in the future in order to help more Black game developers feel supported. <strong>This project is completed and available to view.</strong></p>

                    <p>This audio visualizer utilizes the WebAudio API as well as the HTML canvas to display dynamic shapes and visualizations. I worked on this project for about one week in March 2023. The hearts, bars, sparkles, and gradient background are all drawn using the HTML Canvas. Using the buckets of frequencies received from the WebAudio API, I alter the size of the hearts and the heights of the bars. Larger hearts and higher bars correlate to higher frequencies, while smaller hearts and lower bars correlate to lower frequencies. The presence of these frequencies together creates a unique overlaying effect on the hearts and a casual drop off on the bars at the bottom. <strong>This project is completed and available to view.</strong></p>

My goal in recreating this game was to practice my game development and problem solving skills, as well as offer myself a chance to apply my knowledge of Unity. The progress made so far includes player movement, obstacle spawning, and obstacle rotation. I plan on adding custom collision boxes to the obstacles as well as updating the assets used to feel more accurate in terms of size and color variety. <strong>Development on this project is currently paused as I focus on school work.</strong></p>

I programmed all UI functionality, and I was tasked with developing an endless runner minigame to be featured alongside a barista minigame. The endless runner minigame was paused and placed on the backlog as the team focused on delivering a strong and well developed product within our 3 month timeframe. In this refocusing process, we decided to emphasize UI functionality and our core gameplay loop. I programmed much of the UI within the game, including buttons for switching between screens. <strong>Progress on this project has concluded.</strong></p>

                <p>I am a well-rounded programmer, front-end web developer, game developer and software engineer. I have a deep love for visualizations and visual design, and I am very passionate about program optimization. Using resources efficiently while ensuring the end product is visually appealing is my strong suit, and I would love to bring this dedication to your team! <strong>My ideal roles would be entry level positions in front-end web development, graphics programming, and engine/core tech programming.</strong> When I am not typing away at my computer, I enjoy film, music, reading, and gaming. Some of my favorite games right now include Baldur's Gate 3, Hades, and Tears of the Kingdom. Feel free to reach out to me about anything mentioned here, or even something else entirely :)</p>
